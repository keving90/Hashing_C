This program reads records from an input file, creates a hash table, and places them in the table accordingly. This hash table uses a separate chaining method. The load factor is displayed after each number has been hashed in placed in a bucket. The records in the input file are randomly generated numbers between 100 and 1,000. These numbers were generated in an Excel file. When all elements have been hashed, a summary of the buckets is shown and the chains are displayed.

This program was written for the Advanced C Programming course with UCSC Extension.
